diff two pages.

FAILED:
  Sync-header ring has one cycle read delay.
  Data ring does not have that delay.
  The select signal chose the wrong signal at the boundary of 0x7 and 0x8.
  If we delay select signal, then the data ring won't be correct.

  The sim_main logging double-stores the first row of sync header.
