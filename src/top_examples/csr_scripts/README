README:

common.tcl: common routines used by other scripts
config.tcl: setup MAC address in MAC component
csr_pkg.tcl: collection of routines for setting registers in design over JTAG
init_xcvr.tcl: scripts to perform the Netlogic initialization sequence
show_stats.tcl: scripts to display the statistics information in pkt_gen and pkt_mon
test.tcl: perform a loopback test, need to set up loopback mode before running the test.

pma.tcl: all subroutines related to pma and netlogic, used for testing sonic_v1_11.

Steps to verify the transceiver functionality:

1. Loopback at the MAC level, this can be done by calling the write_local_loopback 1.
2. Loopback at the Altera Transceiver level,
   - By writing to the PCS registers.
3. Loopback at Netlogic level.
   - write PMA loopback bit in netlogic
4. Loopback between two ports.
